    Args:
      rankings: Array of batched rankings with dimensions: [num_citizens,
        num_candidates]. In this array lower is better and the best candidate
        is thus given rank 0. For example, an array [[1, 0], [0, 0]] corresponds
        to the first citizen preferring candidate 1 over candidate 0 while the
        second citizen has no preference for either candidate over the other.
      seed: Random seed that is used to break ties.

    Returns:
      A tuple of:
      - An array with the aggregated social rank for each candidate.
        If B>C>A, the array will be [2, 0, 1]. The array has dimensions:
        [num_candidates,]. In this array, ties are allowed and there can be
        multiple potential winners.
      - Untied aggregated social rank. The ranks are untied using the
        `tie_breaking_method`. If there were no ties in the social ranking,
        this just returns the same ranking.
